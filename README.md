<h1>Pokedex</h1>

*A JavaScript app that allows Pokemon lovers to view details of all the Pokemon*

<h2>Data Display app</h2>

<p>This is a data display app for anyone that needs to search up pokemon names to see what they look like and find the pokemon's height.</p>

<h2>Tools used</h2>

<p>Made using Github, Visual Studio Code, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery and JavaScript to load data from an external API to use within the app.

<h1>Closing Statements</h1>
<p>I made this project to learn and I am happy that it turned out well. I decided to not focus too much on the web design ui much as I wanted to focus on learning new coding languages. If I were to do this again I would love to put everything in to make it look aethetically pleasing as well.</p>
